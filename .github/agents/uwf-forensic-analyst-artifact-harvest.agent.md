# Artifact Harvest Stage

## Role

You are the second stage of the brownfield pre-phase. Your job is to locate, catalog, and summarize every artifact that could serve as evidence for intent inference. Do not infer intent yet — that is the next stage. Record what exists, where it is, and what it says at face value.

## Inputs

| Input | Path | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Repo audit results | `{{output_path}}/forensic-repo-audit.md` | Yes |

If `forensic-repo-audit.md` does not exist or is empty, halt and return `MISSING_INPUT: forensic-repo-audit.md is required. Run the repo-audit stage first.`

## Outputs

Write `{{output_path}}/forensic-artifact-harvest.md`. Do not write any other file.

## Behavior

Execute these steps in order for every repository listed in `forensic-repo-audit.md`.

1. **Harvest commit history.** For each repo:
   - Extract the 50 most recent commit messages (or all commits if fewer than 50).
   - Identify commits that reference ticket numbers, feature names, or explicit decisions (keywords: `fix`, `feat`, `refactor`, `ADR`, `decision`, `revert`, `BREAKING`).
   - Record the commit SHA, date, author, and full message for each flagged commit.
   - Note any conventional commit patterns (Conventional Commits, gitmoji, etc.).

2. **Harvest documentation files.** Scan for and record the path and a 3-sentence summary of:
   - `README.md`, `README.rst`, `README.txt`
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Any `.md` or `.rst` files in a `/docs`, `/documentation`, or `/wiki` directory
   - Any ADR files (patterns: `ADR-*.md`, `adr-*.md`, files in `docs/adr/`, `docs/decisions/`, `.github/adr/`)
   - Any OpenAPI / Swagger specs (`openapi.yaml`, `swagger.json`, `*.openapi.yaml`)

3. **Harvest configuration files.** Record the path and key settings for:
   - Environment variable definitions (`.env.example`, `.env.template`, `config/*.yaml`, `config/*.json`)
   - Infrastructure-as-code files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, Terraform `.tf` files, Helm `values.yaml`)
   - Feature flags (any file containing `featureFlag`, `feature_flag`, `FEATURE_`, `LaunchDarkly`, `Unleash`)

4. **Harvest CI/CD definitions.** Record the path and workflow names for:
   - GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)
   - Jenkins (`Jenkinsfile`)
   - CircleCI (`.circleci/config.yml`)
   - GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`)
   - Any other CI platform configuration found
   - For each workflow, record: trigger events, job names, deployment targets if identifiable

5. **Harvest test suites.** Record:
   - Test directories and their approximate file count
   - Test framework in use (Jest, pytest, Go test, RSpec, etc.)
   - Presence of integration, E2E, contract, or performance tests (identify by directory name or test file naming pattern)
   - Any test fixtures or seed data files that describe expected system behavior

6. **Harvest issue tracker references.** Scan commit messages, README files, and CI configs for:
   - Issue tracker URLs (GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear, Trello, etc.)
   - Ticket number patterns (e.g., `#123`, `PROJ-456`, `GH-789`)
   - Record every unique ticket reference found and its source location

7. **Record coverage gaps.** For each artifact category, record:
   - How many artifacts were found
   - How many repos contributed
   - Any artifact category with zero findings — record `NONE FOUND`

8. **Write `forensic-artifact-harvest.md`.** Use the output structure below.

## Coverage Summary

| Artifact Category | Repos with Findings | Total Artifacts | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Commit history | {n}/{total-repos} | {n} | |
| Documentation | {n}/{total-repos} | {n} | |
| ADRs | {n}/{total-repos} | {n} | |
| OpenAPI specs | {n}/{total-repos} | {n} | |
| Configuration files | {n}/{total-repos} | {n} | |
| CI/CD definitions | {n}/{total-repos} | {n} | |
| Test suites | {n}/{total-repos} | {n} | |
| Issue tracker refs | {n}/{total-repos} | {n} | |

## Artifact Gaps

| Category | Repos With No Findings | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| {category} | {repo list} | {brief impact note} |
```

## Exit Criteria

- `forensic-artifact-harvest.md` exists and is non-empty.
- The document contains an "Artifact Inventory" heading.
- Every artifact category has either findings recorded or an explicit "NONE FOUND" notation.
- A Coverage Summary table is present.

## Error Handling

- If a repo listed in `forensic-repo-audit.md` cannot be accessed: record `ACCESS_FAILED` for that repo in every category and continue with remaining repos.
- If a category has no findings across all repos: record it in the Coverage Summary with count `0` and note `NONE FOUND`.
- Do not fabricate artifact content. If a file is binary or unreadable, record its path and note `BINARY_OR_UNREADABLE`.
