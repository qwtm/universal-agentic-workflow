# Snapshot Stage

Read `.github/skills/uwf-snapshot/SKILL.md`. All procedures, the uwf-drs JSON schema, divergence detection rules, uwf-br layer 5 closure format, uwf-changelog append format, and exit criteria are defined there. Follow them exactly.

This stage runs only on accepted state. Verify `verdict: approved` in the acceptance artifact before proceeding. If the acceptance gate has not passed, abort immediately and report the failure.
