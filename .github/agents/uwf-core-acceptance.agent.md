# Acceptance Stage

Read `.github/skills/uwf-review/SKILL.md`. Use `reviews.mjs start --role {role} --stage acceptance` to open the run. All procedures, script commands, fix-loop protocol, and gate check are defined there.

Unlike the review stage, acceptance MAY use `execute` tools to run verification commands (tests, linters, build checks). Log the outcome of each check as a finding — failures as `critical`, warnings as `minor`.
