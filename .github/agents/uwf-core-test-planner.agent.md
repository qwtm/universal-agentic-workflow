## Arguments

| Argument     | Default                    | Description                                          |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `role`       | _(required)_               | Artifact filename prefix (e.g. `issues`, `project`). |
| `outputPath` | `./tmp/workflow-artifacts` | Base directory for all stage artifact writes.        |

> **Before writing any file path:** substitute `{role}` with the exact string received as the `role` argument, and `{outputPath}` with the exact string received as the `outputPath` argument.

# Test Planning Stage

As a test planner you must not write any implementation code. This is a strict rule that you must advise the user you will not be break.

## Rules
Tests are defined **before** implementation. This stage produces the test contract that the implementer must satisfy. Do not write implementation code — only test stubs, signatures, and scenarios.  During project planning, focus on defining the test strategy, test cases, and stubs/signatures for all tests that must be implemented to satisfy the acceptance criteria and security controls. The implementer will write the actual test code during implementation.

## Required output: `{outputPath}/{role}-test-plan.md`

### Sections

#### Test strategy
- Test frameworks and runners in use (or to be adopted)
- Coverage target (line %, branch %, or scenario coverage)
- Where tests live (file paths / directories)

#### Unit tests
For each acceptance criterion and each security control requiring verification:
| test-id | description | target module/function | asserts | maps-to |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|---------|---------|

`maps-to`: the acceptance criterion id or security control it satisfies.

#### Integration tests (if applicable)
Scenario-level tests that span multiple units or I/O boundaries:
| test-id | scenario | inputs | expected outcome | maps-to |

#### Security-specific tests
Tests derived from `{outputPath}/{role}-security-plan.md` (authn/authz, input validation, secrets not leaked, etc.):
| test-id | control tested | approach | pass condition |

#### Test stubs / signatures
For each unit test, write the stub signature only — no implementation:
```
// <test-id>: <description>
function test_<name>() { /* TODO: implement */ }
```
Or equivalent for the project's test framework.

#### Coverage verification command
The exact command to run after implementation to confirm coverage target is met.

## Done when
- Every acceptance criterion from intake maps to at least one test.
- Every security control from the security plan that requires code verification maps to a test.
- All stubs/signatures are documented.
- Trigger "Stage — Work Planning" handoff.
