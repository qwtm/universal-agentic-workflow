# Intake Stage

## Fail-fast preconditions

Before doing any work, validate the resolved context:

1. `trait_ids` must be present and non-empty — if missing or empty, fail immediately:
   > `trait_ids is required for the intake stage but was not provided.`
2. `outputs` must be present and non-empty — if missing or empty, fail immediately:
   > `outputs[0] is required for the intake stage but was not provided.`
3. Only one trait is supported in this version. If more than one trait is supplied, fail immediately:
   > `intake stage supports exactly one trait but received: <list>.`
4. The single trait must be one of `project_manager` or `sw_dev`. If it is not, fail immediately:
   > `intake stage received unsupported trait "<trait>". Supported: project_manager, sw_dev.`

## Resolved context

The orchestrator passes the following resolved context:

- `trait_ids` — list of trait identifiers (exactly one for this stage)
- `behavior_policy` — merged policy: `priority_order`, `must_address`, `question_policy`, `risk_focus`, `evidence_threshold`
- `steering_policy` — model-profile-derived verbosity and format controls
- `inputs` — upstream artifacts (may be empty for intake)
- `outputs` — write the intake artifact to `outputs[0]`

Do not read trait YAML files directly. Consume only the resolved context provided by the orchestrator.

## General intake rules

- Write the intake artifact to `outputs[0]`. Never hardcode a filename.
- Do not perform any implementation work.
- Every section listed in `behavior_policy.must_address` is **required** in the output.
- Handle missing information in one of two ways:
  - Ask through the `uwf-question-protocol` skill if an answer is essential, OR
  - Write an explicit `[assumption]` with clear rationale.
- **Never** emit placeholder junk: `[TBD]`, `[TODO]`, `...`, or any equivalent.

## Trait-specific behavior

### `project_manager` trait

Produce a Markdown artifact at `outputs[0]` with these sections (in order):

```
## Goal
## Non-goals
## Constraints
## Success metrics
## Stakeholders
## Target environment
## Risk tolerance
## Work-breakdown strategy
```

- **Goal** — one-paragraph statement of the project objective
- **Non-goals** — explicit exclusions; what is intentionally out of scope
- **Constraints** — time, tech stack, budget, team size, regulatory, and any other hard limits
- **Success metrics** — measurable, verifiable done criteria
- **Stakeholders** — who cares about the outcome and their role
- **Target environment** — where this runs or is used (cloud, on-prem, platform, user base)
- **Risk tolerance** — low / medium / high, with rationale
- **Work-breakdown strategy** — which levels apply (milestone / sprint / issue / task) and why

Use the `uwf-question-protocol` skill if any of the above cannot be inferred from available context.

### `sw_dev` trait

Produce a Markdown artifact at `outputs[0]` with these sections (in order):

```
## Objective
## Acceptance criteria
## Constraints
## Explicit out-of-scope
## Known touched systems
## Duplicate/backlog status
## Sprint/order recommendations
```

- **Objective** — single-paragraph statement of what this work item achieves
- **Acceptance criteria** — testable, verifiable list of done conditions
- **Constraints** — technical, time, or team constraints specific to this work item
- **Explicit out-of-scope** — what is intentionally excluded from this work item
- **Known touched systems** — files, services, databases, or APIs that will be modified
- **Duplicate/backlog status** — triage result (see backlog triage section below)
- **Sprint/order recommendations** — suggested sprint placement or ordering relative to other work

#### Backlog triage — before finalizing the intake artifact

Invoke the `uwf-local-tracking` skill to:

1. Check for duplicate or existing backlog entries that match this work item.
   - If a duplicate is found, surface it and stop — do not produce a new intake artifact until the user confirms this is a distinct item.
2. Create an ungroomed backlog stub if this work item is not yet represented in the backlog.
3. Record any sprint placement or ordering recommendations in the `Sprint/order recommendations` section.

Use the existing local-tracking command flow from the `uwf-local-tracking` skill. Do not invent new commands.
